                      BUILDING EO
==================================================================
The basic installatio procedure goes the following:

- go to the EO directory - that was created when you unzipped the
  archive file.

- run 
            ./autogen.sh

- run 
            make

and that's it. You should probably go to the tutorial and start
learning about EO features and programming.

In case of problems, you can read the INSTALL file - but remember this
is a standard installation file from GNU and that it contains nothing
specific about EO.

===================================================================
                       DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
===================================================================
After unpacking the archive file, you should end up with the following
structure:

.../                            the MAIN EO dir, created when unpacking
   |
   +-- src                    SOURCE dir. Contains most EO .h files
   |   |
   |   +- utils          general utilities (e.g. RNG-related source files)
   |   |
   |   +- ga             bistring-genotypes source files
   |   |
   |   +- es             real-valued-genotypes source files  
   |   |
   |   | 
   |   +- gp             Genetic Programming source files
   |   |
   |   |
   |   +- obsolete       files from old versions - for upward compatibility
   |
   |
   |
   +-- tutorial               TUTORIAL dir (indeed :-)
   |   |
   |   +- html           all html files - start by browsing index.html
   |   | 
   |   +- LessonX        for X=1, 2, 3, ... : example of increasing complexity
   | 
   |
   |
   +-- doc                    DOCUMENTATION dir (generated by Doxygen)
   |   |
   |   +- html             HTML files - start at index.html (see also tutorial)

   |   +- man              Unix man format documentation
   |
   |
   +-- test                   TEST files - for debugging purposes only
   |
   |
   +-- app                    APPLICATIONS - one dir per separate application
   |   |
   |   +- gprop            GA/backpropagation for neural nets 
   |   |
   |   +- mastermind       the wellknown MasterMind game

   +-- win                    WINDOWS dir: project files for MS/VC5+



===================================================================
              NOTES
===================================================================
if you extracted a fresh snapshot from the cvs-repository, remember to do:

$> ./autogen.sh --enable-maintainer-mode

instead of

$> ./autogen.sh

before making the libraries.
