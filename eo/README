Welcome to EO,

if you extracted a fresh snapshot from the cvs-repository, remember to do:

$> ./autogen.sh --enable-maintainer-mode

instead of

$> ./configure

before making the libraries.

Documentation can be found in:
   eo/doc/html

And \latex sources for a reference manual in:
   eo/doc/latex

There are currently no examples except the programs in the test directory. 
Only the files mentioned in Makefile.am will actually compile.
