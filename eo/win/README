This directory contains the project files for Microsoft Visual C++

For Visual Studio 2003 (and 2005) you can go to the eo\win (this)
directory and open the eo.sln file. It allows for the compilation of 4
lib files (which will be placed in eo\win\lib). At the moment there
are no project/solution files to compile the test programs(eo\test) or
applications (eo\app).
