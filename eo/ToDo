An old TODO list for EO (from 1998):

Provide a way to easily manipulate the algorithm in runtime, be it
from grafically or text; expand command-line capabities?

Provide a graphical interface for Windows, in VC++ or BBuilder.

Creare more examples of the objects of which there is only one
instance: algorithms, evaluators. Try to adapt most well-know
algorithms to EO

Integrate the gTK interface seamlessly in the library.

Complete documentation.

Try to implemente as algorithms the best known paradigms: Evolution
Strategies, Evolutionary programming.
