This Templates directory contains template files of an EO project and
a script createEOproject.sh to create a complete new EO project.

The template requires a complete installation of EO. 

In particular, the C++ compiler must find the EO include files and the
linker must find the EO libraries. Most probably, that means that you
have to set the variables CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH and LIBRARY_PATH, i.e.
for a standard installation and using tcsh:

setenv CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH /usr/local/include/eo:"$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
setenv LIBRARY_PATH /usr/local/lib:"$LIBRARY_PATH"


See README.manual for more details.
