Eo Tutorial - corresponding to EO version 0.9.2

To start the tutorial, read index.html in your favorite browser.

WARNING: before that, you need to create a link from the html dir 
to the main documentation directory of EO. Probably, you will need 
to type something like
.../eo/tutorial %        cd html
.../eo/tutorial/html %   ln -s ../../doc .

Many things are missing, including many solutions for the exercises, 
the introduction to EC and most of the Bottom-Up pages.
More important, all examples of this tutorial have only been tested 
on a Linux computer, and the Makefile will not work with MS-Windows 
systems. Any help is welcome!

Be patient ...
